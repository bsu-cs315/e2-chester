Controls:
+ A = move left
+ D = move right
+ Space = Jump

Essential Goals:
+ Core Loop: The game can be played from beginning to end. That is, there is a way to start, gameplay that involves kinematic motion and jumping in a 2D platforming experience,
and a clear end to gameplay, and the game can be restarted without needing to reopen the application. - DONE ( Game loops back to main menu after all gems are collected and allows the player to play again )
+ Clean: The project has neither errors nor warnings. The style guides have been followed. The project structure is appropriate.
Conventional rules of code quality, such as Clean Code, are followed. - DONE ( No errors are present and clean code rules are followed )
+ Legal: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the repository, and you have satisfied all license requirements. - DONE ( Read me tracks and credits all licenses )
+ Versioning: The repository is properly configured, in the course organization with no extraneous files tracked, with a single mainline branch, and with all commits following Beams' rules.
A Release on GitHub and the corresponding tag mark the increment. DONE - ( All commits follow Beam's rules and there is a release corresponding to Increment 2.1)
+ Documentation: The report is complete as described in the first week's exercise. - DONE
